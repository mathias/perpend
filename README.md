A place to study data structures and algorithms that I'm interested in. Not intended for production use. Not optimized. Really, don't read into this repo too much.

## TODO

### Checksums:
* [x] [Adler-32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler-32)
* [ ] [Fletcher's checksum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%27s_checksum)
* [ ] [Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRCs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) - CRC32C Algorithm

### Cryptographic hashing:
* [ ] SHA-1
* [ ] SHA-2
* [ ] SHA-3
* [ ] MD5

### keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
* [ ] HMAC w/ MD5
